# The Preferences for Environments Ontology (PrefEnvo)

The PrefEnvO pattern is a specialized framework designed to model the environmental preferences of organisms, capturing their habitat requirements and interactions with various environmental factors. This ontology pattern facilitates a detailed and structured representation of the specific environmental conditions in which organisms thrive, allowing for precise querying and analysis of these preferences.
